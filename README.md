This repository contains my work on the kaggle competition: Cover Type Prediction Of Forest
It contains:

1- The Notebook detailed with demonstrations and scores obtained in both html and ipynb formats:

I recommand visualizing the notebook as html :
  - Go to http://htmlpreview.github.io
  - Add the file path : (here it is https://github.com/MSBigData2019/Sarra_Kazdaghli/blob/master/SD701_Kaggle_cover_type_prediction_of_forest/SD701-TP03_Sarra_Kazdaghli_1.html)

2- 2 csv files for the predictions based on DecisionTreeClassifier and GradientBoostingTreeClassifier
